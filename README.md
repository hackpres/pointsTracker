## Description
pointsTracker is a React app that simulates an async API fetch to retrieve user data and return the users accrued points totals based on retail purchases within a requested quarter year.

    This project uses a simulated API fetch so client side development can continue before a true backend has been completed.

Simply clone the repo. Then open your terminal and navigate to the codebase. Run "npm install" and, once installation is completed, run "npm run start".

The logic to calculate points was pretty simple given the criteria of: A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

pointsTracker is using React state management to maintain the selectedUser, selected quarter, as well as all of the Users data returned from the "API fetch"

Once a user and a quarter have been selected pointsTracker will return the monthly points accrual as well as the total points earned for the selected quarter.
